# Ethiopian-Gregorian Date Converter

## Context

Ethiopia uses its own calendar that differs from most of the rest of the world that are using the Gregorian calendar. The year is less by 7 or 8 years than the Gregorian year depending on the month. It becomes 7 starting from Ethiopian new year, which is 10/11 of September (Meskerem 1 in Ethiopian calendar), and becomes 8 years starting from Gregorian new year (January 1). Furthermore, Ethiopia uses 13 months. 12 months of 30 days each, and a 13th month with 5 days (or 6 on leap years).

## Description

The Ethiopian-Gregorian Date Converter is a single page HTML page helps one to convert calendar from Gregorian to Ethiopian, or viceversa. I created this for my own personal use, and wanted to share it.

**Here is what it does**:

- When you want to convert from Gregorian calendar to Ethiopian, the output will be displayed in the Ethiopian versions for month and day names. For example, if the conversion result is "Tuesday, 15 June 2013", the output you see would be "Maksegno, 15 Sene 2013". 

- But if the conversion output is Gregorian, converted from Ethiopian, the display will be English day and month names. For example, Tuesday, 15 June 2021.

Finally, this project is created using HTML, JavaScript and CSS (custom & Bootstrap V5.3.0 framework).

## Usage Instructions

- If you want to use the code in your local machine, copy and paste the `index.html` on your computer and open with your preferred browser.
